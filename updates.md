Added a repo "new-website". This will be the under-construction repo for the soon to be new website. Parts of this website will still be used, and for now
it will be mainly for updates, though when the final webstie is done most important info will be transfered over. To access the in-progress website, go to
[https://c3productions.github.io/website-in-progress](https://c3productions.github.io/website-in-progress). Collaborators from this website repo will be added
to the new repo as well, notify me (TIny_Hacker) for issues.

Currently, I am thinking about changing the theme to [this](https://tianqi.name/jekyll-TeXt-theme/), which is more customizable and easier to customize in general.

Working on creating a group orginization on github for Celtic III productions. I will also set up a theme (view a demo of the new theme [here](https://longpdo.github.io/neumorphism/))
for the website. Collaborators, please work on adding your projects to the "Projects" section of the site in the meantime, and fill out your about sections.
