# BioHazard
My name is Derek Christianson. I am a TI-Basic Programmer and I enjoy developing programs for the TI-83 Family and the TI-84 Family.
I also develop with web languages and Python. I enjoy the outdoors, and spending time with family.

(Secret: I am the original creator for Celtic III Productions!)

Calculators I own:

  - TI-83 Plus
  - TI-84 Plus
  - TI-84 Plus CE
